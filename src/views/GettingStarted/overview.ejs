    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Without coding knowledge for backend development, users can use my Varvault API for Embedded board device IoT 
        projects, providing a functionality for creating remote variables for monitoring sensor readings, controlling logics, and managing parameters remotely over the Internet. 
        This API can help developers to create user interfaces and applications that enable real-time interaction with Embedded devices from anywhere with an 
        internet connection.</p>
    <!-- <p class="paragraph">Varvault API eliminates the need for close ranged communication modules like Bluetooth, LoRa, or Zigbee. 
        This opens up for deploying Embedded board device-based IoT solutions in a wide range of scenarios, including remote monitoring in 
        industrial settings, smart home automation, and agricultural monitoring.</p> -->
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong>
            Allows users to remotely monitor real-time sensor readings and other parameters from their Embedded board devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Control Logic:</strong>
            Developers can implement control logic to automate processes and trigger actions based on sensor data. Whether it's regulating temperature, managing energy consumption, or responding to external stimuli.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>It offers a flexible interface for storing, updating, retrieving, and deleting variables through HTTP methods, providing seamless integration into client applications.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="bullets1">
            <strong>User Registration and Authentication:</strong> 
                Allows users to register accounts securely.
                Implements password hashing for enhanced security.
                Provides authentication mechanisms for accessing API endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Token Generation:</strong>
                Generates tokens for authenticated users to access restricted endpoints securely. Tokens are time-limited for improved security.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Variable Management:</strong>
    
            Enables users to add, update, delete, and retrieve variables associated with their accounts. Supports various data types, including numeric, text, and boolean. Validates inputs to ensure data integrity and consistency.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Flexible Access Control:</strong> Utilizes tokens for fine-grained access control, enabling users to manage their variables securely.
        </li>
    </ul>
